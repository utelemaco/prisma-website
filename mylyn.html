                      <h4>Definition</h4>
                      <p>MylynSDP is a tool for software engineers to help them to have the most important artifacts at hand when executing software process activities. MylynSDP features a Degree of Interest (DOI) function. This function is responsible to rank elements according to predefined rules. MylynSDP project uses a DOI function during software process activities execution in order to infer the interest of artifacts in relation to the executing task. Interest inference is based on</p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>how much artifacts are manipulated by software engineer and</li>
                      <li>the underlying software process that is being executed.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>When software processes are executed with aid provided by MylynSDP, their specification and interactions performed by software engineers are monitored by DOI function. MylynSDP’s DOI function then calculates the interest value of each artifact in relation to the executing activity. Once it is done, artifacts that have a high interest value are associated to the activity to create an activity context. Thus, an activity context is a set of interesting artifacts to a particular activity. Artifacts with a low interest value are not added to an activity context. As the time passes, artifacts that belong to an activity context are highlighted, as other artifacts are omitted from the view of software engineers.</p>

                      <p>By highlighting interest artifacts and omitting not interest ones, MylynSDP along its DOI function increases the focus of software engineers on the important artifacts and relieves them to the time consuming task of searching important artifacts.</p>

                       <img src="assets/images/imagemIvens_2.jpg" alt="image">
                      
                      <p>MylynSDP’s main interface. On the left column, there is a list containing all artifacts from software development process. On the right column, there is a list of all software process activities. Central area is used to create or edit artifacts. By starting an activity on the right, only the most important artifacts in relation to that activity are displayed on the artifact list on the left.</p>

                     <h4>Problem</h4>

                      <p>Depending on the complexity of the system being developed, its software process may be long, and most importantly, it may contain several activities and artifacts to be executed and manipulated. In order to execute an activity, software engineers need to identify what artifacts should be consulted and edited. The search for those relevant artifacts, which is an activity context, may not be an easy task because they are undistinguished from other artifacts. As a result, the search for the small set of relevant artifacts in relation to an activity execution may be tiring, error-prone and time consuming.</p>

                      <p>Drawbacks related to the search of artifacts get even worse when more than one activity is executed at a time. This means that during the execution of one activity, a second and interrupting activity may call software engineer’s attention due to its higher priority. Consequently, artifacts related to the first activity (its activity context) are either left aside or closed to make room for the context of the second activity. Once the second activity is finished, a new search for the first activity context may be performed. The constant search for artifacts demands additional time and effort from software engineers, which ends up in decreasing his productivity.</p>

                      <p>In order to solve both artifact search and context change problems, MylynSDP was created. It was based on Mylyn, which is an Eclipse plugin that helps programmers on the search for important Java classes in relation to coding tasks.</p>

                      <h4>Development</h4>

                      <p>MylynSDP’s development started with the download of Mylyn’s code. It is comprised with more than 70 Java projects, 300 Java packages and an even higher number of classes. After identifying which projects were related to DOI function activity, their codes were consulted and modified. A new component had to be created in order to import and manage software process specifications.</p>

                      <p>MylynSDP development had two main parts: development and testing. On the first part, its code was written and several implementation problems were solved such as importing an xml, saving data from software process specification on disk and adding / removing artifacts from activity contexts. Later, when DOI function was ready to be edited, MylynSDP’s implementation was tested to better adapt it to software process field.</p>

                      <p>Following those steps, a validation study was conducted.</p>

                      <h4>Validation</h4>

                      <p>A validation study was performed to assess concepts created during research and development of MylynSDP. Validation study had 7 participants, 6 Doctorate students and 1 Master’s Degree student, all from software engineering field. A real software development process was chosen to guide exercises of validation study. Real software process come from SIGA/EPCT project, which aims to hold and manage academic information (such as data from students, professors, classes, materials and grades) from federal institutions in Brazil.</p>

                      <p>Participants from validation study had to execute five guided exercises when dealing with MylynSDP, its DOI function and the executing software process. The time they took to execute each exercise was measured and a space on paper was left to their comments. Results and conclusions from validation study can be consulted on publications below.</p>

                      <h4>Publications</h4>

                      <p>During MylynSDP development, two papers were published:</p>

                      <p>PORTUGAL, I. S. ; OLIVEIRA, T. C. . Introducing Software Process Specification to Task Context. In: 25th International Conference on Software Engineering & Knowledge Engineering, 2013, Boston, USA.
